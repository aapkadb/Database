1. CREATE DOMAIN
Domains in PostgreSQL are a great way to enforce data integrity and consistency in your
relational database. They allow you to create custom data types based on existing data
types with added constraints, default values, and validation rules.

2. 

SHOW config_file;
ps aux | grep postgres

sudo -u postgres -i

pg_ctl -D /Library/PostgreSQL/17/data stop

pg_ctl -D /Library/PostgreSQL/17/data start
